This is a good basis to study, learn and use if you have React/Node/Express skills but not yet database or auth security skills. After you get the backend and frontend installed and working locally, you will have to replace the content with your own content, i.e. it is more of an example app than a blank template, but it has everything you need to publish an online website in which users can identify themselves and change content online.",
